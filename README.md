# About Me:

Finishing my B.S. in Computer Science at Texas State in December 2025, I've spent my college years building real software across enterprise sales platforms, EDI integrations, and internal tooling systems. From optimizing logging infrastructure with RabbitMQ at Dell to building time-tracking applications that eliminate manual data entry, I'm drawn to problems where good engineering directly improves how people work. My technical foundation spans Python, C#, TypeScript, and .NET, but what I really care about is understanding the 'why' behind a system before jumping into the 'how.'

## Current Focus

Working on **AutoDoc**, a CI/CD tool that automates documentation generation from Git commit metadata. Working with a 3-person team through Agile Scrum, building Python AST parsers, Docker containerization, and GitHub Actions pipelines to eliminate manual documentation processes.
