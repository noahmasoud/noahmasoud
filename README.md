# Hello, I'm Noah 

Currently pursuing my B.S. in Computer Science at Texas State University, I've spent the past few years turning theory into practice through multiple industry internships and hands-on projects. I've learned to be resourceful, ask the right questions, and figure things out—skills that translate directly into how I approach engineering. Whether I'm building RESTful APIs, designing database schemas, or deploying web applications, I focus on writing clean, maintainable code that solves real problems.

I'm particularly interested in working on solutions that will actually be used. I like the idea of creating software that can be used as a tool for developers—systems that make their workflows smoother, faster, and more reliable.

## Current Focus
